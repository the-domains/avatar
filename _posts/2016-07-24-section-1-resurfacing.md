# Section 1 - Resurfacing

_Who am I? Why am I here? Where am I going?_

ReSurfacing(r) is a new approach to these age old questions. You will find the answers by exploring the underlying structure of your own consciousness.

The ReSurfacing Workshop (Section I of The Avatar(r) Course) produces insights into what Avatar is about and where it leads. It is presented by Avatar Masters in an informal group setting that permits lots of interaction and sharing.  
Here you will experience a greater connection with and insight into the nature of personal reality. The exercises bring forth a you that transcends all the ideas you've imagined yourself or the world to be. This moment of transcendence, or resurfacing, is a glimpse into the realm opened by the Avatar materials. Welcome home.  
Section I exercises take you behind the scenes of consciousness for a look at the blueprints by which you build your life. The journey results in an intimate connection with a deeper, more compassionate and aware state of self.  
Section I is offered in an affordable 2-day workshop that contains information, demonstrations, and experiential exercises to awaken you to the unlimited possibilities of living deliberately.

ReSurfacing refers to the action of disentangling yourself from old creations and rising back into awareness. It is a process, paralleling nature, of revealing yourself to yourself. The rewards are new insights and realizations about how your life works---or why it doesn't.  
ReSurfacing is an expedition into consciousness that you personalize according to your own needs. How far you go is a matter for you to determine, and the truth you discover will be your truth.

The exercises will lead you to an experience of your personal study materials. These are the motives and principles that govern your existence. They are as unique as your fingerprints. Discovering them will take you to new places and new viewpoints that will dramatically broaden your comprehension of existence.  
As you proceed you will become aware of your own creative power. It will surprise and amaze you. Should you choose to follow this power to its source, you will find a measureless sea of awareness extending beyond time, consciousness, and creation. Ancient companions wait for you (t)here.

The cost of Section I is $**295.00** USD.
