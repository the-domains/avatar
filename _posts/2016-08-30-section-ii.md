# Section II

On Section II of The Avatar(r) Course you practice the specific abilities and tools that are required to successfully manage what you are already experiencing in life. It's an opportunity to get your affairs in order before the big adventure begins. Section II clarifies and expands an extrasensory perceptual channel to the physical universe that you may already be vaguely aware of-extended feeling. This is a nonsensory feeling that does not require physical contact. It quiets the mind and dramatically enhances your sense of being.
!["With the Section II materials, you start exploring. Little expeditions into the backyard of your consciousness. You practice the specific abilities and tools that are required to successfully manage what you are already experiencing in life. It’s an opportunity to get your affairs in order before the big adventure begins."

Section II develops your ability to create a reality that you prefer. Deeper access to your own mental programming results in transformational realizations about why certain aspects of your life have fallen short and what you can do to correct them.

You turn the part of self that was your worst enemy into a guiding friend.

Self-sabotaging beliefs are exposed before they can do you more harm. Stress is replaced by a relaxed awareness.

You learn how to experience reality without judgment, separation, or distortion.

Section II requires 4 to 5 days to complete, depending upon what is encountered.

The cost of Section Two is $**500.00**\***USD**.
