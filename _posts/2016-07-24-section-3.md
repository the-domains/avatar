# Section 3

Section III is the main course. It begins with a guided initiation session conducted by an Avatar Master.

The initiation takes you on a tour of some of the most fundamental, transparent belief structures of consciousness. Transparent, because instead of seeing them, you see through them. The initiation experientially introduces you to procedures and tools that you can use to self-determinedly manage your life. Normally, it is an insightful and enlightening experience and may leave you in a euphoric state for some time.

Section III of The Avatar Course develops your ability to discreate realities that act as hidden reefs and barriers to your operation as source. An Avatar Master takes you on a guided initiation that introduces you to, and allows you to discreate, some of the most fundamental (and previously transparent) belief structures of the universe.

Next, you complete solo rundowns that permit you to address body sensations, interpersonal conflicts, dependencies, limitations, persistent conditions, compulsions and (without words or argument) the beliefs of others.

When you are able to manage any aspect of your existence from a creator viewpoint, you have achieved the state of being called Avatar.

Section III requires 2 to 4 days to complete.

The cost of Section III is **$1500.00**\***usd**.
